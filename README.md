## About the Video Course
With every successive console generation, the cost, time, and complexity of developing games has grown. Meet CryENGINE3, a middleware engine that is the perfect fit for most developers, allowing users to exceed current generation quality standards. When creating a game, good level design is what the end user sees the most. More often than not, there is more than one way to achieve a desired effect in a level. This course shows you every way possible to achieve this effect.

CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design covers various aspects of level design while informing the budding designer of ways to achieve their goals with less effort. Even with no prior knowledge of game design, CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design will show you everything you need to know about game level design, starting from how to load the CryENGINE 3 SDK on to your PC all the way to packing up your first level to play.

In order to make your game level look presentable, the course starts off by helping you get a grasp on the basics, such as creating your first level, working with models, terrain creation, and material editing. However, your journey doesn't stop there, as you will then gain further knowledge of more advanced features such as creating flowgraphs and particles, adding sound, and debugging your level.

By the end of this course, you will be armed with the skills you need to start creating game levels and scenes. While watching these videos, you will learn game creation tactics that not only work for the CryENGINE, but also for most modern day game engines.

Code bundle of this course comes along with the game created in the video course with the CryENGINE Free SDK Version 3.4.5
