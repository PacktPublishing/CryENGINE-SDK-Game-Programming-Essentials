This is the code repository for [CryENGINE SDK Game Programming Essentials [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/cryengine-sdk-game-programming-essentials-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781849697460), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	
CryENGINE is a complete game development solution that can run on multiple platforms. Its aim is to give intuitive tools to the developer, and it is one of the most beginner-friendly engines out there. It comes with a fully featured audio offering, AI and game scripting by Lua or the graphical Flowgraph system, an integrated physics engine, and a full suite of performance analysis tools. The ‘What you see is what you play’ Sandbox editor is the best feature of using this engine for game programming and it allows anyone, developer or not, to get in there and create something cool and unique.

This video course provides you with hands-on exercises that walk you through programming with CRYENGINE using C++ and Lua. Everything is presented with visual learners in mind, so you not only see what is happening on screen but also participate in creating your own code through step-by-step instructions.

In this video course, we start out by getting ready for the CryENGINE code by setting up our Visual Studio. Next we learn the correlation between editor-spawned entities and those spawned through C++. We then set out to create our very own entity in C++, in particular, a Proximity Mine entity. Further on, we will add Lua functionality to our newly created entity.

Further into the course, we turn our attention to the Flowgraph editor where we create some advanced AI behaviors and then proceed to test them out. Lastly, we will create our very own “Mine Listener” Flowgraph node that will be used to listen for mines being placed by a target entity.

CRYENGINE Game Programming Essentials is an amazing and exciting video course that will capture the interest of all aspiring game programmers. The activities you perform in this course are fun, practical, and tackle real-word game programming problems with ease. This video course will help you greatly in your endeavors to become a game programmer.
